Todo:

- Load next word while playing current word so that animations can be run
  smoothly
- Make next word take current word as a parameter so it doesn't load it again
- Make the images display at a max height appropriate for the device so that
  they don't push the word parts off the screen
- Make the word parts display at a size appropriate for the device so that
  they are easy to swipe
- Better feedback when you make a correct swipe
- Make it so you can touch the word to hear what it is in case you can't tell
  from the picture
- Make it so the word part sounds optionally play when you touch them?
- Splash screen with "sw" being swiped into "ipe" and "words" animating in

Questions:
- Should we have animated words for swiping verbs instead of just nouns?
- How would swiping sentences work?
